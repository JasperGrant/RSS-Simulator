# RSS-Simulator

Simulator for Robotic Spacecraft Simulator project.

Includes catkin workspace containing full C++ thruster plugin, simulated RSS Gazebo model and simple script to pathfind to a specific point or follow a second RSS.

Repo was created before gaining formal ROS and robotics education so beware inefficient and straight up wrong methods to problems.
